                He turns to the camera as we hear the sound of the engine running.
                (He gets up from his seat and opens the door, gesturing for the camera to come inside) 
                (The camera enters the RV, which is revealed to be a mobile bakery. The counters are lined with various baked
                goods and there is the smell of fresh baking in the air)

                Walter White: So, what do you say? Are you in for some of the best baking you've ever had?

            <p>
                What do you mean you don't like them? I put a lot of hard work and dedication into making those cookies!
                I don't want to hear your excuses. If you don't appreciate my baking, then you should leave. I don't have time for people who don't appreciate quality.
                And don't come back unless you learn to appreciate good baking!
